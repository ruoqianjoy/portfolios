### Data Visualization Samples

[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joy4396)
-	Connecting to a data source
-	Creating simple graphs and visuals
-	Basic interactive dashboard
-	Understand and use different joins in Tableau (INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN)
-	Creating a storyline and advanced dashboard

-	Practice problems:
-	    Long-term US Unemployment Stats by gender and age

[Power BI](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/LTV%20%26%20Predicting%20Next%20Purchase%20Day.ipynb)
-	Performed analysis using rollup and drill down, slice and dice, sort and rank on 1 year of historical sales data for a global online retailer to compare monthly performance (e.g., growth rate, numbers of active customers, new customer ratio and retention rate, etc.)
-	Performed SWOT analysis on consumer marketing initiatives.
-	Used K-means to segment customers into 3 clusters (high, medium and low value), based on their recency, frequency and monetary values.
-	Performed customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis by using BG-NBD Model, and cohort analysis (retention over user & product lifetime).
-	A GridSearchCV tuned Random Forest multi-class Classifier (84% accuracy) was implemented to predict the CLV classes.

[Predict Household Electricity Consumption with Machine Learning (Machine Learning, Python, Excel)](https://github.com/ruoqianjoy/Projects/blob/main/Retrieving%20and%20EDA%20in%20MySQL_Credit%20Risk%20Analytics.sql)
-	use energy/electricity usage related charactistics like housing unit, usage patterns, and household demographics to build a model that will allow us to understand the status and project future consumption trends
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Implemented Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for regression and fitting
-	Evaluated the performance of the model.

[Home Credit Default Risk Prediction (SQL, Machine Learning, Python)](https://github.com/ruoqianjoy/Projects/blob/main/Retrieving%20and%20EDA%20in%20MySQL_Credit%20Risk%20Analytics.sql)
-	Calculated credit-to-income ratio, average income, numbers of bad debt and refused accounts, etc. for 300,000 records using SQL.
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
-	Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, the performance of the later method was improved by 17%.

[Post Marketing Campaign Analysis (A/B Testing, BI, SQL, Python)](https://github.com/ruoqianjoy/Projects/blob/main/Post%20Campaign%20Analytics_Marketing.ipynb)
-	Acquired data from marketing campaigns of a Portugal bank, and implemented data pipeline with SQL connector in Python.
-	Visualized 10,000 campaign records in Plotly, an interactive plot enables segmentation of different campaigns and other characteristics (e.g. users per age group, valid offers per day).
-	Completed conversion and retention rate analysis, determining the most effective channel which obtained highest conversion rate (34%).
-	Applied A/B testing on the email channel, the statistical significance showed the customized emails improved marketing efficiency by 39%.
